# Evolving a Lunar Lander

Evolutionary Algorithms are a powerful tool used for optimising and searching problems, inspired by the natural selection process. In this project, an EA is used to find the best possible weights of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) used to control a fleet of identical spacecraft, after using most of their fuel, regardless of their different starting positions and velocities. An extensive search was done to find the best hyper parameters of the EA that could find the most effective weights.
